- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
     
    It was pretty cool to see how what i'd learned from the code academy tutorials applied to making a real site.  This was the first time coding a site with HTML. So it was a pretty awesome feeling testing it in my browser and seeing it load pretty much as I was hoping it would.  (there where a few minor errors the first time we ran it but we quickly figured out what the problems were and corrected them.)
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

    I've never used html in the past so it was a little weird at first but there are so many great recources online so it was super easy to look up any elements I wasn't sure about.  I guess that is the big advantage of only having one mark up language for websites.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

    I think we did o.k with formatting. All our list items are nicely lined up and indented but I think overall things could look a little neater. I find html is much harder to keep neat and orderly than ruby.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
    
    The good thing  about html is that it's very simple to use and there are so many great rescources to help you out.  It performs it's function very well but even though it's simple to understand I do not find it simple to write at the moment.  I'm sure I will get used to it over time but right now I find that using so many < and > simbols really slows down the process of writing. 
    

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

    The most useful trick I've adopted so far is writing my opening and closing tags at the same time before I fill in the content.  This prevents problems with forgetting to close tags.
