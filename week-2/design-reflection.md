What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

  The primary goal of my site will be to show potential future employers (and anyone else that may be intersested) my development skills and also tell them a little about me as a person. The site will feature links to any development projects I work on during DBC,  A short personal Bio,  a link to my technical blog and contact information as well as social media links.  I may also include links to another site showcasing my work as an underwater photograper and videographer (once I get round to building it).

What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

   I'd imagine my audiences primary interest will be who I am and what I'm capable of as a developer.  My site will most likely address these by showcasing my work and by linking to my blog.
  

What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

  I'd imagine the primary action of my users will be to view my portfolio and personal bio.  They may also want to seach my blog for posts about specific topics or just browse through it manualy. They may also want to contact me via E-mail or social media.

What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
   
   Well I guess there are a lot of things to know about design.  The main thing to know is that everystep is important. It is not enough to produce a beutiful looking website if it does not functon properly of fails to meet the clients needs. User experience is very important to consider. Sometimes what you or the client want won't provide the best experience for the user so you must always consider how your site will actually be used when designing.  
  

What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 
  
  User experience design is striving to design a website or system that provides a positive user experience.  This means taking into acccount how users feel about a system in terms of ease of use, accessability and efficiency and trying to make it as pleasent to use as possible. 

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious? 
  
  The part I found most tedious in this challenge was the reflection but this is often the case for me a writing is not something that comes naturally to me. I had a little trouble finding the proper path to copy my image through the command line. I then miss typed it several times which was frustrating.  I'll have to put more effort into practicing command line use and increasing my typing accuracy.
