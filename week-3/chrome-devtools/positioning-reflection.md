How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

  Chrome devtools alows you to view and edit the scource code of a site whilst viewing the effects in real time.  It's pretty freakin awesome!!  It makes positioning and any other task in CSS so much easier it's like night and day.  There are even handy checkboxes for 
  activating and deavtivating the effects of specific lines of css.  You can just edit the code in the browser and see the effects of your changes hsppen right before your eyes.

How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

 There are a couple of different ways to change the size of an element dependin gon its type.  A div can be resized easily by simply changing the 'height' and 'width' values. e.g. div {height:40px; width:40px} with give the div a size of 40x40px. You can also effectively increase the size of an element by incresing the 'padding' around it. 

What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

 asolute positioning fixes an objects position relative to it's nearest postioned ancestor (i.e. an ancestor with any position other than static). Fixed positioning positions elements relative to the viewport so it will remain static when the page is scrolled.  Static is the default positioninig applied to elements if an element has static positioning it is not considered to be positioned. 


What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?

   Margin is the invisible space around an element. Border is the line around an element it can be assigned different sytles and thicknesses.  Padding is the space between the element itself and the border.  Padding is set to 0 by default but can be set to any value you choose.

What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
