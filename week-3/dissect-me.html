		<h2>CSS Positioning</h2>

		<p>
        If you're looking at the image above and thinking 'Wait, why would you use an image of such poorly aligned things in an article about positioning?' then clearly you have yet to experience the bittersweet joys of CSS.   If this is indeed your first venture into the world of CSS positioning then know this, it will NOT be easy.  In-fact you're likely to give serious consideration to setting fire to your computer and running away to live a tech free life in the forest  before all this is over.   Rest assured though, CSS has been used to style practically every page on the web for a good fifteen years now and despite it's awkward and fiddly nature it really does work once you get the hang of it.   
      </p>
      <p>
        The first thing you're going to need to get comfortable with if you're going to make your layout work is the different types of positioning built into CSS.   Any HTML object can be assigned a 'position' property within your CSS style sheet.  These position properties come in four different types: static, relative, absolute and fixed.

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

  I used <header> <nav> and <main> in this challenge I've used header many times before because every page i've made do far has required a header and using this tag saves the need to set up a div id for the header and makes the code easier to read.  <nav> and <main> where both new to me but now that I am familiar with their usage I will add them in to pages i've already made. I can think of a few ocassions off the top of my head where i've used div or section when one of these would be more apprpriate.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

  Unless told otherwise by a stylesheet or style tags the browser simply displays the elements in the order that they appear in the HTML document with eveything agianst the lefthand edge of the page. 

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

   Sublime is even more awesome than I thought.  I'd never used tabtriggers or code snippets before but I will definately be making lots more in future.  I've also discovered I can get sets of tags by just writing the word and hitting tab.  This is a revelation I can't belive ive been writting tags out by hand all this time!!!
