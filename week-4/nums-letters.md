What does puts do?
 
  The puts command returns nil and prints the output of a method to the console on a new line. 
  It is the most commonly used command for printing results in ruby.

What is an integer? What is a float?

  An interger is any whole number i.e. a number without a decimal point.  A float is short for 'floating point number' and is any number with a decimal point.  

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
   
    Ineger devision will only return an integer e.g. 7/2 == 3.  Float devision will return a float as an answer e.g. 7.0/2.0 == 7.5.  An easy way to think of it is to imagine that integer devision is like deviding items that are indivisble.  For example if a Plane ticket to San Francisco costs $200 and you have $500 you can buy 2 tickets NOT 2.5 (no-one will sell you half a plane ticket.)
