  I feel more confident with positioning elements in CSS but i'm still not confident with the method for separating a list or block of text into columns using column-count.  I understand how the method it supposed to work but I find it is fiddly and unpredictable in practice. Personally if I wanted to have two columbs like this I would rather have each one in a seperste div or section so that I can control their  positioning more effectively.
