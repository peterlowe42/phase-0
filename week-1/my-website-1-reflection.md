Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

   To create a new repository on GitHub you first need login to your GitHub account at GitHub.com(If you don't have an account you'll need to create one).  On your account page you'll see a + icon in the top right corner. Click on the + and select 'New Repository'.

   This will take you to a simple form.  Fill our the repository name, add a discription in the description box and Decide if you want the repositoy to be public or private. You should also check the initialise with README box and select MIT licence under the licence option. Now click the green 'Create Repository' button.  

   Your repository has now been created and GitHub has automatically loaded your new repository page. To clone this repository to your computer you'll first need to copy the URL found in the 'HTTP clone URL' box on the right hand side of the page.  Now open the command line on your computer and navigate to the directory where you want the clone to go.  Type 'git clone ' followed by the URL you just copied and press enter.  The repository hasnow been cloned to your computer.

Describe what open source means.
   Open scource is a term used to discribe a piece of software that allows the user access to the scource code.  I.e. The code used to create the program.  Non open scource software only contains files that have been transated to be read by the CPU. These cannot be understood by humans.  Open scource software also contains the orional code files written in a programing language that canbe understood by those who know how. This allows the user to alter or add to the program. 

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
    
    I love open scource!!! This is the way software should be. I like the idea of people being able to add to and improve sofware that i've created allowing it to evolve and develop over time.  It may not be as profitable as keeping your scource code a secret and charging a premium for it's use but it's been proved many times over that you can still make money desining open scource software and it's much more friendly and colaborative. 

Assess the importance of using licenses.
   
    Using licences is very important as it establishes exactly what a user can and can't do with your code. Even if you make your code open scource it is still protected by copywrite(in the US at least).Using a licence means that there are clear guidelines on how it can be used and distributed by others so you don't have to spend all your time reviewing copywrite requests from people who want to use or alter your code.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

    This exercise mostly helped to solidify the concepts covered in 'Tracking changes'.  I genreally don't fully absorb information until i've had to use it a couple of times so having to repeat all the steps to create, modify, commit and push a repository was really useful. This was also the first time I have ever made a website or used html so opening up my page at the end was definately a good moment for me. I struggled a little with remembering the git commands I needed to use but I resisted the temptation to look back through my notes because I knew I would remember it better if i figured it out without reference.
