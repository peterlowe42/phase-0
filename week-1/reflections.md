# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

Personally I have never been very good at time management, especially when it comes to independent study.  In the past I have tried making 'to do' lists and schedules to force myself to use my time better but these tend not to work to well for me as the more I feel pressured into doing something the more I tend to procrastinate.  

So my plan  for phase 0 looks goes like this:

At the start of each week I will review all the assignments and order them in terms of which ones I find most interesting or intriguing.  In order to motivate myself to do the tasks at the bottom of the list I will only allow myself to do one of the 'fun' tasks after I've finished a less fun task. (Hopefully this will help, We'll see how it goes.)

Each work day will be broken up into 25 min Pomodoros in order to make the workload seem less daunting and intimidating.  Once I've got a feel for my work rate I will start assigning numbers of Pomodoros to each task.  I will allow myself regular short breaks for cups of tea in order to maintain morale.  I will also strive to be mindful of when i'm becoming overworked and losing productivity and take a longer break to draw or meditate.  

Ultimately my goal is to not focus too much on hitting deadlines and finishing all my assigned tasks for each day but rather reflect on how I feel about each days work.  If I feel like I've used my time well and done all I can with my day then that's a win. If not I need to manage things better the following day.

## 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

This was a great exercise for me because I've never really attempted to use the command line for anything before and always considered its use to be some kind of technological sorcery.  I can now see how useful and it can be and that it can in fact be quite simple to use.  Anyway here's my answers to the questions:

1. A shell is basically any program that provides the kind of text based interface that you find in the command line.  It takes text commands in, feeds those commands to the CPU and gives text based output.   Bash is a specific shell program first released in 1989 that is used as the standard command interface for linux and osx. 

2. The most challenging aspect of this for me was simply getting use to the idea of using text based input and output and relating what I was typing and seeing in the command interface with the graphical items i'm familiar with.  After one or two exercises it was pretty straight forward and kind of fun. 

3. Yes. I used all the commands successfully.

4. It's hard to say at this point what the most important/useful commands will be. I'm sure i'll have a much better idea once I've used shells more regularly.  At the moment I would say that 'pwd' will be very useful (if your not using windows cmd line which constantly tells you what diredctory you're in anyway.) also cd, less/more and grep/select-string.

5. pwd- Stands for print working directory and simply outputs the directory you are currently in.

    ls - lists all the items in the working directory

    mv - moves a file or item to a new location within the directory.  This often  equates to renaming the file

    cd - changes the working directory

     ../ - I'm  not totally clear on what this does. I think it executes certain files.

    touch - Creates a new file or changes the time on an existing file.

    mkdir - makes a new directory 

    less - prints the contents of a text file screen by screen.

    rmdir - removes a directory 

    rm - removes a file

    help - can be used to get help on how to use unfamiliar commands
